simple Promoter Recognition in DNA Sequence
Promoters are the regions in DNA sequence typically located near start sites of genes.
Promoter recognition is an essential step in finding the exact location of starting transcription.
We used artificial intelligence methods to identify a DNA sequence as a promoter or non-promoter, this is simple projetc
in this project we used Database: E. coli promoter gene sequences (DNA) with associated imperfect domain theory
